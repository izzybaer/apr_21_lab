# Bob and Carol Screw Up 

Hello. Bob and Carol here again with another update. We made some changes and pushed them to the design comp branch and now we have made another new branch, and are making a new feature. Then we are going to push up to that branch. 

This is what Bob and Carol worked on. Bob was navigator for Carol, and now, finally, Bob is in control and he is driver.
